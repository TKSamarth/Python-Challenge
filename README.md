# 🐍 Python Skill Up – Skill Up Python

## 📌 Enrollment Confirmation
I have successfully enrolled in the **Python Skill Up** course by **Skill Up Python**.  
**Start Date:** 1-10-2025 

This repository will be used to document my **learning journey**, **code exercises**, and **projects** as I progress through the course.

## 🎯 Course Goals
- Master Python fundamentals (variables, loops, conditionals, functions)  
- Understand Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python  
- Learn data structures and algorithms using Python  
- Build mini-projects to strengthen practical understanding  
- Prepare for real-world Python development and problem-solving

I’ve officially shifted from **Java → Python** and will now be coding exclusively in **Python** until I become fully well-versed and confident.  
Every day, I’ll be solving problems, building projects, and sharing progress here on **GitHub**.
